# Matlab Codes for 3D Anthropometric Analysis & Digital Human Modeling

I have prepared useful Matlab algorithms in order to be used in 3D Anthropometry and size/shape analysis for 3D body scan images. I will keep updating my codes as an open source algorithm.

Contents
- Loading/Saving 3D scan image file (.PLY format)
- Loading/Saving anthropometric landmark data
- Landmark identification
- Alignment of 3D image with the Cartesian coordinate system
- Measurement of length, width, circumference, and curvature dimensions (under updating)
- Virtual fit analysis (not provided yet)
- Template registration (not provided yet)
- Symmetrization (not provided yet)
- Surface Parameterization / Mesh Flattening (not provided yet)
- Morphing / Posture change (not provided yet)
- Sizing / Clustering (not provided yet)
- etc.
