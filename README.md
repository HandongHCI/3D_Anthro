# Matlab Codes for 3D Anthropometric Analysis & Digital Human Modeling

Introduction
- This is an Matlab library for 3D anthropometric size/shape analysis based on 3D body scan images.
- This library contains licensed codes.
- This alborithm keeps updated.

Contents
- Loading/Saving 3D scan image file (.PLY, .STL, .IGS format)
- Loading anthropometric landmark data (.ASC or .IGS format)
- Basic strategy for landmark identification
- Alignment of 3D image with the Cartesian coordinate system based on landmarks
- Measurement and analysis of point-to-point distance, surface length, and circumference dimensions
- Analysis of surface curves on the body
- Virtual fit analysis (not provided yet)
- Template registration using ICP algorithm
- Deformation/morphing using BBW algorithm
- Symmetrization of 3D human body (not provided yet)
- Surface parameterization / mesh flattening (not provided yet)
- Mesh editing & modification
- Posture change (not provided yet)
- Sizing system generation (not provided yet)
