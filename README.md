# Matlab Codes for 3D Anthropometric Analysis & Digital Human Modeling

I have prepared useful Matlab algorithms in order to be used in 3D Anthropometry and size/shape analysis for 3D body scan images. I will keep updating my codes as an open source algorithm.

Contents
- Loading/Saving 3D scan image file (.PLY format)
- Loading anthropometric landmark data (.ASC or .IGS format)
- Landmark identification
- Alignment of 3D image with the Cartesian coordinate system based on landmarks
- Measurement of length, width, circumference, and curvature dimensions (under updating)
- Body surface curvature analysis
- Virtual fit analysis (not provided yet)
- Template registration using ICP algorithm
- Deformation/morphing using BBW algorithm
- Symmetrization (not provided yet)
- Surface Parameterization / Mesh Flattening (not provided yet)
- Posture change (not provided yet)
- Sizing / Clustering (not provided yet)
- Finite element anlaysis (not provided yet)
- etc.
